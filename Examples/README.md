# While Loops Examples 

## Count Ocurrences of a String inside of a String

Given a string, count how many times another string is found within it. 

You can use `indexOf(String s)` to see if it is found within the String (returns -1 if not found). You can also use `indexOf(String s, int i)` to start looking from a specific index instead of the beginning.

## Count Ocurrences Variation

Look for the number of ocurrences of "code", except the third character can be anything. So "cope", "cooe", etc. would count.
